# Green-to-Concrete_Ratio
This project aims to use AI image processing to analyze satellite or drone images and determine the green-to- concrete ratio in urban areas. We will identify and classify areas of vegetation and concrete, calculate their ratio for urban planning, and develop a method that can be easily applied to assess green spaces in cities.
